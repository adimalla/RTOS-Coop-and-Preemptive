* The Project is working fine till not with few bugs, some of the task were failing after couple of hours but the issue is now resolved for now
* If you kill a task it will be removed from the process table, if you create that task again, then it will be added at the same place instead,
  of getting added at the botton, this is because we are taking the PID of the function which has already been assigned by the compiler as
  address of the function in the stack, which never changes.
  Better way to do it would be to take the PID from the SP value (LSB)?, No, the context is always saved even the stack pointer is the same

* When Priorties are enabled, the debounce is bad
* When preempt is off the tasks run slower, job distributed between Idle and LengthyFn
* When preempt is on Idle has more CPU usage then Lengthy
